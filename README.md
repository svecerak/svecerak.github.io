# Sasa Vecerak - Web Portfolio
First iteration of my personal website showcasing my side projects. This project mainly served as a learning experience and a way for me to learn plain HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript. I've since transitioned to using front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS due to their ease of use. 

Without this fundamental understanding of the basics, I wouldn't be able to appreciate and fully understand the pros and cons of using a framework versus the language itself. 

In the future, I plan to redesign and rewrite my portfolio leveraging some of the new technologies and design principles I've since learned.
